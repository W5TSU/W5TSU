### 73

If you reading this you are woundering who I am.  
I'm a Father, an Artist, a Computer professional, a Radio Control aircraft pilot, an Amateur Radio operator, and a Philosopher. 
W5TSU is my call sign.  I use this Git repository to keep electronics projects.

I'm an Open Source and Open Hardware advocate.
